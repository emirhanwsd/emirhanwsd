Hello everyone, my name is _Emirhan AkpÄ±nar_, and I am a high school student born in 2005. Ever since I can remember, I have been passionate about computers, and during my middle school years, I began exploring software development. Although I started with backend languages, I transitioned to frontend development and discovered that I feel more comfortable working on the frontend. I have also honed my design skills through my childhood curiosity in drawing and designing.

Currently, I work as a _Frontend Developer_ at [Scoutli](https://scoutli.co), where I am responsible for all Frontend work. I also work as a _freelancer_.

I am always eager to learn new things and strive for knowledge, which helps me approach my work with passion and dedication. I firmly believe in the saying _"there is always room for improvement,"_ and I am constantly working towards achieving the aforementioned _"better."_
