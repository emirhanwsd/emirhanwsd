I am a high school student who has been interested in computers from a young age. In middle school, I started learning software development.

At first, I focused on backend, but later I moved to frontend development, where I feel more comfortable. I also enjoy design, thanks to my early interest in drawing.

I enjoy sports, especially football, taking photos, discovering new flavors, and working with computers.

I like learning new things and always try to improve myself. This keeps me motivated and helps me work with passion.
