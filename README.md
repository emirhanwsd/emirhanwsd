### ðŸ‘‹ Hello everybody, let me tell you about myself. This is _Emirhan AkpÄ±nar_. I was born in 2005 and I am a high school student. I am into computers ever since I could remember. I turned this interest to software when I was a mid-school student. I continue with Frontend to which adventure I've started with Backend languages. I noticed to I feel more comfortable on Frontend a few years ago. I developed my design eye by the curiosity of drawing and designing some things that came from my childhood.

#### ðŸ”­ I am working at [Scoutli](https://scoutli.co) as a _Frontend Developer_ and I assume all of the Frontend works. I also work as a _Freelancer_.

##### ðŸ’– Being hungry for knowledge and dealing with new things provides me to be more loyal and treat with love my work. I don't forget that _"There is always better"_ and I am working for the aforementioned *"better"* and I'll work.
